# Customer Churn Survival Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for conducting survival analysis on customer churn.

## Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses. This project aims to analyze and model customer churn behavior using survival analysis techniques. The survival analysis methodology allows us to understand the time until customers churn, enabling us to make informed decisions to retain them.

## Folder Structure

- **/data**: Contains datasets used for analysis.
- **/scripts**: Holds scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **/results**: Stores the results, visualizations, and model outputs.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the analysis steps and visualizations.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: 
    - Explore the datasets in `/data` and preprocess as needed using scripts in `/scripts/data_preprocessing.py`.
2. **Modeling**:
    - Utilize scripts in `/scripts/modeling` for survival model implementation and training.
3. **Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate model performance using notebooks in `/notebooks` and save results in `/results`.
4. **Visualizations**:
    - Create visualizations using scripts or notebooks, and store them in `/results/visualizations`.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, lifelines, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
